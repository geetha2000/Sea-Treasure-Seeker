# Sea-Treasure-Seeker

Sea treasure seeker is an android game application which keeps the concept of the 
game simple yet exciting at the same time. Throughout the game, the user has to 
collect the coins and diamonds along its journey while avoiding getting injured by the 
enemies. 
   When the user touches the screen of the mobile, it is considered as sensory input for 
the game. Gain in sensory input moves the character upwards, while loss of the 
sensory input moves character towards the bottom of the screen. 
   Based on the coins collection, user will be scored. All the diamonds collected by the 
user at the end of the game can be cumulatively used to buy new characters in the 
game. 
   Progress and feedback about the game can be shared with the developer and 
other friends through mail or other social media.
